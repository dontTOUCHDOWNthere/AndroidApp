# ShoppingList
My first try at making an android app.

Making an app that will let you add item food names and prices. It will save that info to a database with SQLite. Using that database, you can then select foods and add them to your list where the app will keep track of the total price so that you can know about how much money you are going to spend before you even get to the store.
